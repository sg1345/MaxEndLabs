                    In the world of Olympic Weightlifting, names like Suleymanoglu and Dimas are spoken of with reverence. Today, a new name has joined that pantheon: <strong>Karlos Nasar.</strong>
                </p>

                <h2 class="fw-bold mt-5 mb-3">The Paris 2024 Explosion</h2>
                <p>
                    The atmosphere inside the South Paris Arena was electric. Going into the 89kg category, the world knew Nasar was the favorite, but nobody expected the clinical precision he displayed. With a successful 180kg Snatch, he set the stage for his signature move: the Clean & Jerk.

                    "I don't just lift for myself; I lift for the history of Bulgaria and for everyone who believes that limits are meant to be broken."

                <p>
                    When the weight was loaded to 224kg—a world record attempt—the room went silent. Nasar approached the bar with a calm that defied his 20 years of age. The clean was effortless; the jerk was a masterpiece of power and stability. When the three white lights flashed, a new Olympic and World Record was born.

                <p>
                    Nasar’s journey hasn't been without hurdles. After a freak injury in 2023 that threatened his career, his comeback has been nothing short of miraculous.
